# JellyEditor3
JellyEditor 3 is an updated version of the JellyCar 1 level editor, based on the original source code (thanks, Walaber!).
If you're interested in downloadable, runnable versions, see https://www.adamenglish.net/jellycar/je3/.
This source code is intended for use with Visual Studio 2019, but should also work in older/newer versions of Visual Studio.
